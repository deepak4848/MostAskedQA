Local(Use inside function) and Global(Use Outside anywhere function) verible.Veriable in C#.difference between var And Dynamic keyword.
SelfJoin-Jion with self table
DataType in SQL-Int,Float,Decimal,Char,Varchar,Datetime.Diff b/w Char(Fixed Length),Varchar(Variable length) & nvarchar(Veriable length,Supprot unicharacter,international text)
DataTypes in C#-int,float,String,Boolean,Char,String,enum,struct
DataTypes in JavaScript-let(Globle Scope,Entire Function),Var,Constant
Constant(declare constants,Con not be Changed,not change compileTime) & Readonly(used to value inetilized constructor,Change Runtime)
Abstract(TypeofPoymorphism-Overriding,have fields and properties,not create object so inheret,base/drive) and Interface-both used to abstraction
constructor-
singleton and static class in c#
interface vs abstract class
a)Local var use inside a function not accessible outside function,Global var use outside of other function or anywhere.
b)var store any type of data strin,int,array,boolean it change on compile time.
Filters(Action,Authorization,Result,Exception) in MVC Core.Filter vs Middleware,concept of Filters in MVC?
Explain Model, View and Controller (business,Data layer-Model,display-User,Logic)
Middleware in mvc core.
Types Of Class-Abstract(Inheret by Other class),Static(Not Inheret by Other Class),Sealed(Not Inheret by Other Class),Partial(class Devid into Partial),Nested Class
Access Modifier-Public,private,protected,Internal
Design pattern-MVC,DI(Dependency Injection),Repository 
TypesofView-Partial View,Partial view and partial Class
a.view-layout page,markup tags like body, HTML, head, title, meta etc include,not lightweight as compare to Partial View.
b.Partial view-no layout page(no header,footer)
DI-software design pattern allows us to separate the dependencies of a class from its implementation.Loosely copuled and Titly copule 
Method overloading and Method Overriding.
Difference b/w MVC Core or What's new in version 8.0,7.0,5.0
Constractior in c#.
return types and action method
return is action method type(ViewResult{html content},JSONResult{jsondata},RedirectResult{URL},ContentResult{text, XML})
What is the difference between ‘ViewResult’ and ‘ActionResult’?
differentiation between View and Partial View?
multiple filters are used in MVC, how is the ordering of execution of the filters done?
differentiate between ActionResult and ViewResult?
1.1)Temp data:pass data one controller to another controller/one action to another action,Store data short time
1.2)View data:pass data controller to view.
1.3)View Bag: also pass data controller to view.
What is statemamangment
different properties of MVC routes? Route Name,URL Pattern,Defaults,Constraints (ControllerName,ActionMethodName,Parameter),URL{controller}/{action}/{id}
validation in MVC? DataType, Required, Range, and StringLength
ViewState in MVC?
different return types of a controller action method?ViewResult,PartialviewResult,RedirectResult,jsonResult
MVC Scaffolding?code generation framework
Razor View Engine in MVC?
HTML Helpers & Methods?TextBox,ActionLink,CheckBox,DropDownList,Hidden,ListBox,RadioButton,TextArea,Password
What is Boxing and Unboxing in C#? 
difference between Interface and Abstract Class in C#? 
difference between constant and readonly in C#?const is static, cannot change compile time the value,mandatory to assign a value 
Readonly is the keyword whose value we can change during runtime or assign it at run time but only through the non-static constructor
diff b/w String and StringBuilder in C#?tring immutable(not modify/change) object,StringBuilder mutable(refrence type) object.
 partial classes in C#? Why do we need partial classes?split the same name of a class into two or more classes in the same source code
difference between boxing and unboxing in C#?
What is the Singleton Design Pattern, and how to implement it in C#?
main pillar of Oops?Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism
Abstraction and Encapsulation?show only necessary features without background details is Abst.wrapping,data,var,methods,functions in single unit is Encap
Method Overloading?method name is same, but parameter,parameter order,parameter type is diff,CompileTime Polymorphism(Early Bind)
Method Overriding?base(Parent) class (need to mark a method as virtual) method in derived(Chield) class with different logic but same method name(override keyword) and same parameter.RunTime(Latebind)
Can we write the logic in the Interface?before 8.0 no but in we can write
diff b/w “Stored Procedure” and “Function”?
diff b/w the DELETE & TRUNCATE commands?
diff b/w a Local Temporary and Global Temporary Table”?
SQL joins?Inner,Outer(Left/Right),Full 
A string value can’t be changed. Each time you change a string variable, it actually creates a new string instance and dereferences the old value String is immutable
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (collection of unchangeable/read-only variables).
State mamangment is technique(process to maintain data,behaviour) in c#.server side(Session,application state) and client side(viewstate,hiddenfield,Coockies,QuryString).
What is the Singleton Design Pattern,ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access 
--------------------------------SQL-----------------------
Trigger-Special type of store procedure use to track deleted record or information(DML,DDL)
View-Virtual table data not store in database(to improve performance,DataSecurity,hide actual table information)
Where,GroupBy,Having-where used for filter data on condition,GroupBy use for take value in group used by aggerigate function having clause contain aggregate function with group by
SubQuery is Query with in Query
Index-Retrieve dataFast.Used to speedup data searches/queries.Syntax-CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name on table_name (column_name);
SQLsubset-DDL(Create,Alter,Drop,Truncate)/DML(Select,Insert,Update,Delete)/TCL(Commit,Rollback,Saveprint)
Delete(DML)-Used to delete on or more record with condition but not delete schema(tbl structure) delete from employee where id=2,roll back
Truncate(DDL)-used to delete all record,not used where condition,not delete schema(tbl structure) truncate table employee,not roll back
Drop(DDL)-used to delete all record,delete schema(tbl structure) drop table employee,not roll back
StoreProcedure-return or not return value,sp have i/p & o/p both parameter,call sp inside function,try catch ex in sp
Function-must return value,F have only i/p parameter,not call sp inside function,try catch ex not in Funct
CTE-Common Table Expression is an expression that returns a temporary result set.Reference with in SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE
Nth Higest Salary-select distinct Top(N) salary from employee order by salary desc-->select top(1) salary from (select distinct Top(N) salary from employee order by salary desc)result order by salary
--------------------JavaScript----------------------
different data types-Permitive(valuetype-string,number,boolean,undefined,null,symbol),NonPermitive(ref type-class,array,function,date,RegExp)
array-special type of object used to store a collection of elements(data).store multiple values within a single variable[].array special kind object
object-nonPremitive dataType,define in {},let obj1={A:"a1",B:10,C:"a3"},it's dataType,store data in key/value pairs
Scope-Where data is access,Global(OutsideFunction)/Function(insideFunction)/Block(inthis {}/incondition,inside if/else)
Hosting-declare a variable using var, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its containing function or global scope.
 “ == “(check only value) and “ === “(check value and dataTypes also) operators.
$is aleas of jQuery,($/Jquery)are same
let(block scope dataTypes,use only inside function{}),var(Globle,Use outiside any function) & Constatnt(Can not changed once inetilize,it is also block scope)
getElementById-to find HTMLelement(div id),Single Element
getElementbyClass-select multiple elemnt
getElementbyTagName-
Undefined and Null-variable decliearde but not assigned a value(valuenotGive),let x;x=??,print-O/p-Undefined,null-variable is decleriad but value is given null.
